# Bunny Bop!
## I. High Concept
As a bunny in the Wild Forests, the player must guide Bunny as it hops leaf to leaf to get the tastiest fruit! However, they must BEWARE THE ROTTEN FRUIT! The rotten fruit will make Bunny sick and unable to continue collecting good fruit, ending the game. However, if the player can avoid the rotten fruit then Bunny will keep climbing higher and higher with the player's score increasing by 100 points with every good fruit collected.

## II. Genre
This game is an action platformer where the character hops platform to platform to collect fruit for points.

## III. Platform
This game is currently in development as a desktop-inly web game, though later versions for iOS and Android are a possibility.

## IV. Story
Bunny has just moved out of the family den and has settled into a cozy den of its own. However...
Bunny has gotten hungry and finds it has no food. To make matters worse, Bunny is seriously craving some good fruit salad and the fruit store is closed at this time of day. 
So this means Bunny must set out to gather a good bushel of fruit to make a tasty fruit salad to eat! However, eitout the proper processing and cleaning of the fruit store fruit, Bunny must watch out for gathering bad fruits that will give it a nasty tummy ache.

## V. Esthetics
### Graphics Style:
Bunny is going to be styled in a simplistic, chibi-like style while the leaf platforms, fruit, and background will maintain a similar cartoon appearance.

### Music:
The main music for the gameplay and home menu will probably be an upbeat tune (which are similar but maybe vary in instruments). Potentially an instrumental version of The Wiggles' "Fruit Salad" song.

### Jump Sound:
The jump sound (which is cued every time Bunny hops from a platform) will be a "sproing" sound (like a cartoon spring being pushed down, then released).

### Fall Sound:
The falling sound (which cues when Bunny eats a bad fruit and falls from the platform out of sickness or when Bunny misses a platform) is a "swoosh" sound.

### Score Sound:
Every time Bunny successfully snags a good fruit, a soft "boop"/"pop" sound will play (essentially a "bop" sound).

### Damage Sound:
When Bunny eats a bad fruit, a soft "splat" sound (like something mushy hitting the floor) will play to let the player know that they had messed up.

### Button Press Sound:
When the Play, Options, Replay, and Quit buttons are pressed, a "pop" sound will play (like a bubble popping in a cartoon).

## VI. Gameplay
### Mechanics:
The player directs the character (a cute bunny) platform to platform (which are big tree leaves) while collecting fresh fruit. Each fruit collected is worth 100 points. The height climbed by Bunny do not affect the score, only the amount of good fruit collected (so as to make the game more challenging for players).
The game ends if the bunny doesn't make it to the next platform and falls or if bunny is directed to a platform holding a bad fruit, which makes it sick and fall down.

### Control:
The movement is controlled by the right and left arrow keys as well as the A and D keys of the WASD keys. Bunny's hop mechanism is automatic and requires no button cue from the player, which means the player must make split second decisions.

### Onboarding
* Instructions on how to move appear on screen and then the user is instructed to press enter to continue
* Instructions on what is a good fruit and what is a rotten fruit appear on the next screen, with the instruction to press enter to go to the next page
* How the score works appear on the final page and finally the user is prompted to press enter to start the game

### Player learning
The player must learn the distance Bunny is able to jump to determine if they can reach the next platform. They must also get used to
Bunny being able to go disappear on one side of the screen border to appear on the other half of the screen. The player must develop 
their reflexes as well.
